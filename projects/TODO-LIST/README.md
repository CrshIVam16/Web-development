# To-Do List App 📝

A simple **To-Do List** web application built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
You can **add, edit, and delete tasks**, set a **due date**, and your data stays saved even after refreshing the page.

---

## Features ✅

* Add a new to-do task
* Edit an existing task
* Delete a task
* Set a due date for each task
* Tasks are saved using **localStorage** (they don’t disappear on refresh)

---

## 🧑🏻‍🏭 How to Use

1. Enter a task name in the input box
2. Select a due date
3. Click **Add** to save the task
4. Click **Edit** to modify a task
5. Click **Delete** to remove a task

That’s it. Simple and practical.

## ⚙️ How It Works (In Simple Words)

* Tasks are stored in an array
* The array is saved in `localStorage`
* When the page loads, saved tasks are shown again
* Edit loads the task back into input fields
* Update replaces the old task

This is how real apps manage data in the browser.
